Driving is an essential aspect of our everyday life, and the safety of driving should be the priority for all drivers. We wanted to build an app that helps the drivers stay safe on the roads by being more aware of their emotions, and save them money by having customized insurance plans based on their risks. Our app is programmed to analyze the emotions of drivers and can give an estimate of the change of cost in their auto insurance plan.

## What it does

InsureMotion is a mobile app that tracks your driving to determine whether or not you have a road rage problem. Stay calm and collected while driving? The app will help you reduce your insurance premiums. The app will film you while driving and look for facial expressions to detect emotion. The emotion data is used to see how calm and collected you can stay while on the road.
